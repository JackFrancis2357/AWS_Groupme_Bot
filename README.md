# AWS_Groupme_Bot

Screenshot is in the repo of the file structure for the Lambda code.

Two environment variables are set (Configuration > Environment Variables)
* GROUPME_BOT_ID
* TOKEN

I don't think there are any custom settings in API Gateway, just make sure to actually click deploy once you've set it up (Couldn't figure out why mine wasn't working the first time)
